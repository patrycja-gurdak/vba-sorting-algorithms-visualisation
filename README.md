# vba-sorting-algorithms-visualisation
Main purpose of this macro is to show simple visualisation of four different sorting algorithms and compare their time complexity. User can choose among bubble sort, gnome sort, selection sort and insertion sort algorithms and adjust speed of visualisation. Numbers to be sorted can be chosen from numbers directory. Sequences recommended for visualisation are 3, 5 and 10 numbers long. Longer sequences should be preferably used for time comparision.
Blue colored cells symbolize numbers yet to be sorted, green - numbers already sorted, yellow - cells currently beeing processed by chosen sorting algorithm.
